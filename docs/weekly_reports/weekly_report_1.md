# Weekly Report 1

This week I attended the kickoff lecture and spent a few hours on researching the topic suggestions.
Initially I was very keen on picking dungeon generation as my topic as I've always been interested in generating immersive dungeons for game worlds.
However, as the focus of this course is the algorithm at the core of the project, I decided to pick gomoku since it'll likely lead to less distractions.

After that I spent a few hours researching gomoku, the minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning.
Equipped with more knowledge, I created a repository and wrote the requirements specification for the project.
I have not yet started implementing the program, but I did outline a basic project structure for it.

Next week I'll start working on the core logic of the game.
The aim is to have the necessary data structures in place for game states so that I can start working on the minimax algorithm as soon as possible.

Researching the topic, I learned that there's quite a few different variants of gomoku, such as freestyle, renju and swap2, that are used in tournament play.
Does it matter which one I pick for this project?
